        <h1>Note from Ghost</h1>
        <p>Dear, dear reader, you've made a terrible mistake. <br>
            You must have known of stories of me, the Library Ghost,<br>
             who murders all that stay past midnight. <br><br>
            
            Now, now, the doors are all locked,<br>
            and you are at my whim and mercy. <br>
            Your fault, completely, that you stayed past closing time. <br><br>
            
            I am an old soul,<br>
            Malicious but bored,<br>
            So you are given a chance of escape.<br>
            
            Follow my clues, play my games,<br>
            to find the secret way out.<br>
            May the cleverest survive. <br><br>
            
            To help your chances,<br>
            For the first challenge, <br>
            Here is the Morse Code chart. </p>
