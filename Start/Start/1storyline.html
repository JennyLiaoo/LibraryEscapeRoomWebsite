    <p class="message">You have a special, secret place in the library that<br>
        nobody ever goes to. You go there and accidently fall<br>
        asleep there. When you wake up, it is already 11 pm, <br>
        an hour after the library has closed. Rumors has it<br>
        that this library is haunted, and anyone who has <br>
        stayed past midnight was found dead in the morning. <br>
        Presumably killed by the same ghost that moves books <br>
        around and makes creepy noises at night. You have until<br>
        midnight to get out. </p>
