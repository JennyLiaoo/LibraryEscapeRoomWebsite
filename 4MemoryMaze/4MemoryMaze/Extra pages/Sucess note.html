            So, you've made it out. Congratulations on not getting killed!<br>
            
            I must admit that I didn't think you'd get here. <br>

            But it was great entertainment for me!<br>
            
            Now, hurry along home, and don't you tell anyone of my gamesâ€¦ <br>
            
            Actually, even if you do, they'll just think you're crazy. <br>
            
            But still, congratulations on completing all my challenges!<br>
            
            Good game!<br>
            <br>
